# Splits
Splits is an application designed to view the content of your workout conveniently. Once signed up, users can choose one of three workout splits and easily view the workout associated with the day. 

Because this current version of the application follows hardcoded data, this means that if you decide to work out on a Sunday, which is a rest day across all splits, then you will see "REST DAY" instead of any workouts.

In the future, users will be able to schedule workouts on different days. For example, with the Full Body split, you have full body 1 on Monday and full body 2 on Thursday. With future development, users will be able to rearrange workouts to tailor their preferences and schedule. For example, if one prefers to do full body 2 before full body 1 and wants it on Tuesday and Saturday instead.
